# Robot Framework Reporter Action

This action reads and parses output.xml from Robot Framework test run and outputs it. By default action checks if `pull_request_id` is defined and outputs the report to the found pull request. If it doesn't find `pull_request_id` then it will use the `sha` value by default. These both values can be overwritten by user to have more control. It will also supports outputting report to job summary.
